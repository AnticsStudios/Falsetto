# Sound-Project
The idea of this project was to create a game that was related heavily on sound for our game sound management course.

# Falsetto
The team started with an idea of a game that was similar to a matching puzzle game, it quickly evolved to a 2D side scroller to allow for more fun for the player whilst matching the sounds.

Originally movement was only planned for the Y axis, however the player now freely can move and must dodge objects and use different pitch to break glass, or explode the bombs if they are in the players way. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.  

All game art and program code is original and provided by our team.
