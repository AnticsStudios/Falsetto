ATTENTION ALL PEERS: PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH!!!

PULL BEFORE
YOU DO
ANY WORK!!!!

If you are having errors, try the following:
->Pull
->Commit
->Pull again
->Commit / discard any conflicts (you may sort pending conflicts in sourcetree at the top left of the UI)
->Push!

If you are still having errors pushing/pulling, close Visual Studio & Unity on your computer (if open)
